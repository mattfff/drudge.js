Drudge.js
=========

Drudge.js is a bookmarklet designed to facilitate easier browsing of
drudgereport.com. Politics aside, I like to read the Drudge Report,
however the old school newspaper style is cumbersome to read when you
return to the site frequently, as new items can be added anywhere on the
page, and it's time consuming to try to figure out which links are new
and which you've seen before.
